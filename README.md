I installed MongoDB for Windows 64 Bit on an Azure hosted VM running Server 2012.

##Getting it running

Execute the following command in the root directory:

```
npm install
```

Right now, some errors will occur. I need to fix something but haven't looked into it yet :)

The project will still run locally. You can either debug using Visual Studio Code, or you can fire it up by running the following:

```
node server
```
